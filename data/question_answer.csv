    "question": "how morcco has won his independency?",
    "answer": "Morocco gained its independence from colonial rule through a combination of political, social, and armed resistance movements. The road to independence can be traced back to the early 20th century when Moroccan nationalist movements began to emerge.\n\n1. French and Spanish Colonial Rule: Morocco was divided between France and Spain in the early 20th century. The French began colonizing Morocco in 1907, establishing a protectorate in 1912, while the Spanish occupied the northern parts. The colonial powers exploited resources and imposed their laws and administration on the Moroccan population.\n\n2. Emergence of Nationalist Movements: Despite attempts to suppress nationalist sentiment, Moroccan nationalist movements started to gain momentum in the 1920s. The most influential movement, the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, was founded in 1944 and became the leading nationalist organization.\n\n3. Armed Resistance: Alongside political movements, armed resistance played a significant role in securing Morocco's independence. In 1953, a large-scale armed uprising, known as the \"Resistance Army,\" was launched against the French. Led by Sultan Mohammed V, the resistance weakened French control and put pressure on the colonial power.\n\n4. International Pressure: Morocco's independence movement received support and recognition on the international stage. Particularly after World War II, there was a growing global sentiment against colonialism. The United Nations and other world powers began advocating for colonial territories' self-determination, including Morocco.\n\n5. Negotiations and Independence: In 1956, France and Spain recognized Morocco's right to independence. Sultan Mohammed V became the king, and Morocco regained sovereignty. The process was finalized through negotiations led by the king and representatives of the nationalist movement.\n\nIt is important to note that Morocco's independence was not achieved through a single event but through a series of struggles, both political and armed. The determination and efforts of the Moroccan people, alongside international support, ultimately led to the country's independence."
